- make a new MC release (propsosal)
- build the software stack
- publish the software stack
- run test jobs against the proposed software stack
- produce plots, do release validation

- actually job-script pipelines !
- report back feedback about jobs / QC
- show links to production things

(c) 
- run analysis QC jobs on existing productions

- show

(d)
- collect list of open MC productions
- collect list of MC tags in use
