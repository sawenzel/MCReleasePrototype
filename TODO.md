Tasks to be done

 [ ] Inject alibicompute01 token as github secret (so that it doesn't need to find token on tmp)
 [ ] Write action task to prepare list of available async releases
 [ ] Write action task to prepare list of available MC releases
 [ ] Prepare matrix of compatible releases
 [ ] Demonstrator for complete QC workflow
 [ ] RelVal issues
 [ ] Write action task to publish template for issues
 [ ] Write action task to provide release notes for found releases (w.r.t.) to some release using LLM/GPT


Ideas:

* Investigate integration with JupyterNotebooks and SWAN,CERNBOX integration (for the compute). Could we do the QC analysis, plotting step as part of the notebook?
* Google CoLab
